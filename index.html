    <p>Hey there! My name is Joshua Alabre and all aspects of coding is similar to the phrase, "Rome was not built in a day." 
    In coding you are always trying to fix and better your code.
    I'm just going to start off by saying,"I LOVE CODING!"</p>
    <p>I am from Hartford Connecticut and when it come to coding, it is always about probelm solving.
    I always feel accomlished and happy whenever I make my code work. From small to big fixes, I
    love figuring out what elements makes a code do what. I speacialize in HTML, Javascript, and CSS.</p>
    Everyday is a new day to grow and better your code. And I love calloborating with my co-workers on projects. 
    I am always suprised what types of coding tricks I learn from your fellow colleagues.  
    <p></p>
     <p class="clear"> Before I started coding. I graduated from Wheaton College with a BS in Business and Administration.
     And I also ran Cross Country and Tracka and Field in high shcool and College.
     I am also apart of a track club called Hartbeat track club and train for marathons.
     I also love traveling and plating video games. Best genre of games for me is RPG(Role Playing) and FPS(First Person Shooters).</p>
